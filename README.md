### About

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.

It replaces REST as an API design paradigm and is becoming the new standard for exposing the data and functionality of a web server.

In this tutorial, I'll learn how to build an idiomatic GraphQL server entirely from scratch. I will use the following technologies:

- Apollo Server 2.18: Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance and great developer experience, graphql-js and more.
- Prisma: Replaces traditional ORMs. Use Prisma Client to access your database inside of GraphQL resolvers.
- GraphQL Playground: A “GraphQL IDE” that allows you to interactively explore the functionality of a GraphQL API by sending queries and mutations to it. It’s somewhat similar to Postman which offers comparable functionality for REST APIs. Among other things, GraphQL Playground:
  - Auto-generates comprehensive documentation for all available API operations.
  - Provides an editor where you can write queries, mutations & subscriptions, with auto-completion(!) and syntax highlighting.
  - Lets you easily share your API operations.
